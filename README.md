Clustering by Class-Prior Matching (CCPM) is a clustering method based on class-prior matching. 
Thanks to kernel model (not kernel method), it can capture non-linear structures and parameters such as bandwidth and regularization paramter are automatically tuned by cross-validation. 
This work has not been published yet, and I'm not sure if this is so promising or not. 
I'm waiting for your feedbacks. Thanks for reading :)
Note: LSPClusterer is only for 2-clusters problem.
