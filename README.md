Clustering by Class-Prior Matching (CCPM) is a clustering method based on class-prior matching. 
Thanks to kernel model (not kernel method), it can capture non-linear structures and parameters such as bandwidth and regularization paramter are automatically tuned by cross-validation. 

Note: CCPM is only for binary clustering problems.
